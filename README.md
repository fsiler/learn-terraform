# Learn Terraform

Based on [this guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/build) from Hashicorp.

TODO:

- figure out SSH pairs and init scripts on AWS
- figure out Windows on GCP.  Presently, can't get RDP to spin up, so it's unclear if it's an issue of patience on my part or if the script somehow hangs the system.  Perhaps I can enable RDP myself earlier on in the process?
